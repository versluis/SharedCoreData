Shared Core Data
================

An example from WWDC 2012 to demonstrate how you can have 
one managed object context with more than one store file 
(one of which could be synced to iCloud).

The code snippet was missing from the Developer Library when I had a look today
so I'm glad I found it con GitHub and forked it.
